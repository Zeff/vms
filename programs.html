              <p class="showcase-em">All of our programs have multi-age classes to benefit all the students included.  The younger ones benefit from the mentoring of the older ones, and the older ones reinforce for themselves the concepts they’ve learned.  This process results in more than memorization of facts. The outcome is true understanding and learning.</p>
              <p class="showcase-em">The classrooms themselves are prepared to nurture the characteristics of each age group.  The furniture in the room is built to their physical size and most are made from natural materials.  Everything is made to be real to replicate their home environments and to make a connection to their outside world.  In addition, the rooms have plenty of natural light coming through, and the walls are not cluttered.</p>
              <p class="showcase-em">Another unique feature of all our Montessori environments are the materials Dr. Maria Montessori developed to kinesthetically teach the child concepts for their the children's academics and development.  Many of these materials are also made with natural elements and are aesthetically pleasing, drawing the young children with their innate love of learning.</p>
              <p class="showcase-em">Please continue looking into each of our programs to see how these general elements are specifically developed in each age group.  For additional information, please see our VMS Handbook.</p>

              <p class="showcase-em">One of the main focuses in the toddler classroom is to support the young child with independence.  This is woven throughout the activities of the day.  The child is encouraged to do whatever action they are capable of doing, which is often more than we give them credit.  This is depicted in the picture with the little girl zipping up her coat and the girl washing her face, both with the needed materials at their height.</p>

              <p class="showcase-em">Toddlers also develop a sense of self-reliance by following through an activity from start to finish such as setting the table, scooping their cereal, pouring the milk and taking care of the final cleanup. The following video gives an inside look at a toddler carrying out this process.</p>

This can be seen with the boy using the animal language cards, the girl placing the balls in the correct holes in the box, and the two boys working on screwing and unscrewing nuts on the bolts.</p>

              <p class="showcase-em">In addition, guidance is given on listening, following directions, and using words to express oneself. One main time this is experienced is during the Tasting of the Week where a food is chosen to taste everyday that week and language is chosen to describe the experience and tastes.  A comical representation is provided when lemons were the taste of the week and this little boy gives the typical reaction to the sour and tangy taste of the juices.</p>

              <p class="showcase-em">As mentioned in the onset of our program page, a connection to the outside world is an important part of a Montessori education.  With the toddler aged child, this begins with observations, language and basic work of gardening.  The little boy looking out the window can observe the birds, other animals and plants, and hear the different sounds of nature while language is used to identify the type of birds and other general descriptions of what is seen.  The trough outside the window is used in the warmer seasons to grow lettuce or other plants, allowing the children to make watering their garden easy and part of their everyday work.</p>

              <div class="spacer3"></div>
              <p class="showcase-em">In the next stage, from age three through six (kindergarten), children strengthen coordinated movement, articulate language and grow in their independence.  The materials offer opportunities to learn fundamental academic elements, while at the same time cultivating concentration and other supplementary benefits to learning.  The overall goal, one that overshadows the particular goals of "curriculum areas," is offering many opportunities for the child to develop a profound self-confidence and a healthy, happy, strong self-image.</p>

              <div class="spacer3"></div>
              
              <p class="showcase-em">The primary classroom is known for its “practical life” materials, where the transitioning toddlers or new three year olds are initially directed.  These materials help the child make connections to real life aspects of everyday living, such as folding cloths, washing a table and how to pour.  In our two pictures here, one child is working on food prep, peeling a carrot, and the other child is washing the windows.  The outside environment is part of the working classroom, and this demonstrates, too, that children want and love to be a part of the daily runnings of classroom or home.</p>

              <div class="spacer3"></div>

              <p class="showcase-em">Another key area in the primary classroom is the “sensorial” set of materials that visually and kinesthetically provide value for different sizes, weights, and textures.  As with most of the Montessori materials, a control of error is built into the materials, allowing for the child to fix their own mistakes and also provides a built-in test.  This girl is using one of the knob cylinder sets, establishing the pattern of shortest to tallest.  However, as mentioned earlier, concentration skills are being developed, and the material has a direct correlation to the pincer grip used for writing.</p>

              <div class="spacer3"></div>

              <p class="showcase-em">Moving into the language materials, children progress from tracing sandpaper letters, labeling objects to writing short stories.  Writing stories begins with the moveable alphabet, as seen in this picture.  The child will start sounding out words with the teacher’s assistance, but eventually carries on independent word building and eventually having an entire story on their work rug.  Once writing skills have developed, they will then write their moveable alphabet story on paper.</p>

              <div class="spacer3"></div>

              <p class="showcase-em">Additionally, the primary math materials provide an abundance of hands-on experience in understanding abstract mathematical concepts.  The materials start with basic counting concepts, exhibiting zero means nothing and then build to the four operations, not only with math facts but carried over into multi-digit equations.  Some of them also lay the groundwork for higher mathematical concepts such as squaring and algebraic formulas presented in future education.</p>

              <div class="spacer3"></div>

              <p class="showcase-em">As biology and geography lessons encourage exploration of the world around them, students are also immersed in an environment enriched with fine art on the walls and music, sparking their creative energies.  Our pictures here show a girl working with some abstract art in the outside environment, a boy matching the brown bells in the key of C with the white control of error bells, and an older child showing a younger child how the spherical earth can be translated to the two dimensional maps of the earth.</p>

              <p class="showcase-em">In addition, guidance is given on listening, following directions, and using words to express oneself. One main time this is experienced is during the Tasting of the Week where a food is chosen to taste everyday that week and language is chosen to describe the experience and tastes.  A comical representation is provided when lemons were the taste of the week and this little boy gives the typical reaction to the sour and tangy taste of the juices.</p>

              <p class="showcase-em">As mentioned in the onset of our program page, a connection to the outside world is an important part of a Montessori education.  With the toddler aged child, this begins with observations, language and basic work of gardening.  The little boy looking out the window can observe the birds, other animals and plants, and hear the different sounds of nature while language is used to identify the type of birds and other general descriptions of what is seen.  The trough outside the window is used in the warmer seasons to grow lettuce or other plants, allowing the children to make watering their garden easy and part of their everyday work.</p>
